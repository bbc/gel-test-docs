## Applicability

This rule applies to any HTML page that includes BBC GEL Typography.

## Expectations

### Expectation 1

There must be sufficient contrast between foreground text and backgrounds, in line with [WCAG 2.1 1.4.3 Contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).

### Expectation 1

Do not suppress zooming by touch on handheld devices, either with `<<meta name="viewport">` or any other means.

### Expectation 1

Acronyms and initialisms must appear in all-caps.

### Expectation 1

Links must not be differented by colour alone. While colour may be used, it must be supported by another visual style. Underlining links with body copy is the simplest, easiest, and best understood method of indicating that content is a link.

### Expectation 1

Do not underline non-link text. Because underlines are commonly used to indicate links, non-linked underlined text can be confusing.
